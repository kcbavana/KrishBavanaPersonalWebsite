				Hello All, I am Krishna Chaitanya Bavana but most people know me as Krish Bavana.  I am currently a first year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science (and I am planning to Minor in Entrepreneurship) at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and my expected graduation is May, 2023.  I attended Naperville North High School for four years of High School and Graduated in May, 2019. 
				I love writing and expressing my views on Technologies, Leadership, Time-management and my Journey. I have always loved writing from my childhood. Even though I started blogs in July, 2019, I always wrote something from a very early age. After four years of High School, I found my passion in Computer Science, Data Science and Entrepreneurship. Even though I have seen myself as a full time writer, I always wanted to write about Technology and Leadership. I always loved challenging myself in every phase of my life. I wanted to try something new that no else would. I did both Computer Science Classes and Yearbook (Journalism) Classes together during my high school life. Now I am planning to Blogging, Computer Science, Data Science and learn about Entrepreneurship together. I update my blogs every week here and on UIC Radio Blogs.
				Hello All, I am Krishna Chaitanya Bavana but most people know me as Krish Bavana. I am a student who recently graduated from Naperville North High School. I am starting my new journey at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Everyone has some kind of passion in their lives, and mine lies in sharing my stories (Both fictional and IRL) with as many people as I can. Going from a school with 2800 people to a university with 30,000 people, I learnt a lot of lessons, and have been part of a lot of new and different stories and situations that I wanted to share with you guys, along with some tips to improve your lifestyle, and make the ride a little easier, and a whole lot more enjoyable.  Thank you for joining the journey.
