          Speech, speaking, speaker: these were few of the words that excited me the most since the 5th grade. I was taking pictures and videos for my school’s graduating class during my freshman year, and I was amazed by people speaking so confidently during the commencement. Right from the day I saw those speeches, I wanted to be a graduation speaker and speak at my commencement in my senior year. It would be really strange if an English Language Learner (ELL) student told about his dream about talking in front of five thousand people; people would laugh about it. Luckily, I was always a good speaker from childhood, but my speaking skills became a thousand times better because of Advanced Speech class during my second semester. If I am able to talk so confidently in front of many people, the majority of the credit goes to my teacher and my peers from my Advanced speech. I decided to explain four reasons why everyone should take a speech class during their high school and college.

        It boosts your confidence. I always enjoyed talking in front of people but I never imagined myself talking in front of five thousand people. If I was that confident in speaking during those events, it was just because of my speech class.

        You can always learn something. I was always super excited to go to my speech class everyday. I always got a chance to learn something about a hand gesture or body movement or anything. Watching others’ speeches was always the best part because I learned something new from every single speech.

          Writing a speech is an art. Writing a speech was always a hard task for me. Especially when I used to write persuasive speeches, I would always mess up the writing structure. I got to learn a lot about writing speeches and how everything will impact the audience.

          Class gives you a lot practice. When we are in a standard English class, we usually have one speech or usually. But if you are in a speech class, you will at least give five to six speeches in a semester, and you will receive a lot of practice.

          Advanced speech gave me so many memories and taught me many skills that improved my public speaking skills. I have transformed from an average speaker to a graduation speaker. I just didn’t learn how to speak, but I also met so many great people in that class. Thank you to my Advanced speech teacher for making that class a great memory in my life. If you ever get a chance to take a speech class, don’t hesitate to do it.
