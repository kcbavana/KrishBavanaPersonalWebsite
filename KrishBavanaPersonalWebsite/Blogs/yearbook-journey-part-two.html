            After my Sophomore Year, many things have changed in my life. I started taking Advanced Placement (AP) classes for the first time, I was running an aeronautical club of fifteen people, I was leading another group called First Class and most importantly I was fulfilling my dream of being one of the editors for The yearbook. I was the photography editor in the yearbook. But, before I knew it junior year started with a bang and lots of happiness, I was the happiest person in the world at that point, but I never realized that happiness wouldn’t stay for long. Just like every time, the first three weeks in the yearbook went like a honeymoon period and I was not facing any problems or challenges until right after three weeks when I hit the wall with my first problem. 
          </p>
          <p class = blog-paragraph>
            I never expected my first big problem to come from something I loved. I started disliking, in fact hating my photography, I didn’t feel like sharing with anyone at that point. It was really painful because people around me loved them so much, and thought they were beautiful, but for me, something was feeling like it was incomplete. Imagine, me hating my own photography, but was giving tips to people on how to take better pictures, the struggle was real. Not only was I hating my photography, but I also missed seeing an ‘A’ in my science class. In the first two years, I had no problem with my grades and did very well in both Chemistry and Biology, but for the first time at Naperville North, I felt like losing both as a photographer and a student. The third and most painful were my coding skills. One thing I loved and saw a future was in my code, but each and every day my skills got worse and worse, and worse. I really don’t know why, but somehow the transition from python to java didn’t seem to go very smoothly. Just when I thought everything was right on track, my life started tipping off the cliff. I was starting to get low for the first time after coming to Naperville North, but I really need to thank three people for being with me at this time; Gretchen Gore, Grace Hoggat, and Rushi Patel. I don’t think I was ever the best editor but Gretchen, you were the best editor while coming to handling tough situations. Grace, I think your motivation was one of the biggest reasons I always tried to do best and give the best. Finally, Rushi, thank you for joining the yearbook and thank you for always keeping us smiling. You three were my favorite part of the yearbook. Somehow, I crossed all those phases and entered into the best phase of my high school, the second semester of my junior year.

            If I have to talk about my high school, it would for sure be  the second semester of junior year. Just right after this semester. I started taking my goals very seriously, and I started to put aside unnecessary things and thoughts in my life. I thought  as a leader too, I thought to improve, and I thought to help others.  I was able to be the best and give my team the best advice. I used to sit with them, talk to them about their problems and I used to try my level best to understand them and make them as comfortable as possible. I really loved myself as a leader, we were able to complete tasks and projects  on time, and at last complete the book. One of the biggest moral support during this phase was Miss. Rochford, I was really happy that she was the substitute for Ms. Mazz because she understood all the problems just like her and solved everything on time. I really can’t imagine someone else taking that position because no one else would have understood the craziness of the class. Thank you for everything.

            Finally, the most awaited moment  has arrived, yearbook distribution. It was one of the  most memorable days at NNHS because everyone loved the book, and my team and I were drenched in their  compliments. The only sad part was Gretchen, Grace, Jayla, Rushi, Tessa and every other senior in the yearbook had to graduate. I was really scared because there was no day without Gretchen in class for the past few years, but now she is graduating and I am going to be promoted as the Managing Editor for the yearbook.
        </p>
        <p class = blog-paragraph>
            Everything was different when Gretchen and Grace left, I was not sure how the yearbook was going to be without them, but then the most beautiful part arrived, Katie deWaard and Ann Zhao. But, just when these amazing people walked through the door, I realized that I will be walking out as  my senior year started to creep behind. Senior year meant my dream of showcasing The dream book was about to come true. I want to show everyone what we all worked so hard for even before the classes began, what we worked on in the summer, where we went to the summer camp, and most importantly how we were able to do the planning of book, cover design in the summer. 
        </p>
        <p class = blog-paragraph>
            Classes started but the big twist was the class size, There  were just twelve members in the class. This was the biggest challenge we had to phase, we had to work on deadlines, coordinate with the publishers, and teach new people how everything works. I don’t know how other editors would have felt l about this  year but I knew it  will be one of the most important years of my high school life. This was one of the biggest tasks given to us, and I am very glad to say we were able to pull it off. one of the biggest tasks ever. Thank you would be a very small word to say to my staff and editors because we were able to complete a 289-page book and 30-page supplement. Leadership is not just about how I dealt with my team, but I believe it was about how well I was able to get the output I wanted without hurting anyone. I thought I might lose my temper one day and shout at people, but I never did, because the yearbook taught me to be patient. If anyone from the yearbook is reading this, let it be the times when I led the group or when Bev or Gretchen or Sara led the group, I want to say thank you so much for being a good influence on me and for making me a man that I can be proud of. Some Honorable mentions are Tammy, Sara Siddiqui, Carter Hall, Julia, and anyone  I didn’t get a chance to mention your name, I love you guys. I started loving my photography again, I got the grades I wanted in Physics and now I can code in many languages and became one of best programmers at my college, Thank you for being the best motivators.

        </p>

            Once again, the day has finally arrived for  yearbook distribution. I was really scared about the book before going into public, but whoever read the book had something good to tell. I think that was the first time I got so many messages in a day and this book will always be a special one. Thank you Mazz, for being the best teacher and for always guiding me in the best direction. I have learned a lot from you and thank you for being the true leader and taking us forward. Thank you Mr. Williams for always being there for me and listening to my problems and giving the best suggestions. If my design skills got any better, it’s all because of you.Thank you, Miss. Rochford for being there in a very short period and helping us with many things. Finally, our grammar queen, Thank you, Miss. Richardson (Now known as Mrs. V) for always helping me correct my stupid grammar doubts. If any of you think my writing is good or average, most of the credit goes to the yearbook. I didn’t talk about many things, the yearbook room, the distribution day, the yearbook camp, the yearbook club, club pictures, and many other great stories. For now, I will end the story here and I keep those stories closer to my heart, if any day I feel like sharing any of them I will be back for another yearbook story. For now, this is the end of a beautiful journey.
