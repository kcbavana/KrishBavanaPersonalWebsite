			<p>
				My name is  Krishna Chaitanya Bavana but many people know me as Krish, and very few know me as chaitu. I am a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Entrepreneurship at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Two things that push me forward are coding and business. They challenge me to work harder and think smarter to achieve my goals and dreams in life. Everyone in their life has some kind of passion to do something or to learn something, and with this website, I want to be able to do both. I want to be able to use my coding skills while allowing more people to read and enjoy my content. Every day is a new day of its own, write something new, and learn something fascinating.

				Everyone has a journey in their life, a journey with a purpose. A journey that begins somewhere and ends somewhere. At this point, I can only tell you my start and half of this journey I am taking on. I was born in a very small village in the southern part of India and grew up in the big cities called Hyderabad and Vizag. When I was 14, I moved to the U.S. I completed middle school at Jefferson Junior High School and completed my high school at Naperville North High School (NNHS). I was a person who started to change and evolve a lot at NNHS because I started to understand my love for math, coding, and leadership. Until then I was just a normal 13-year-old kid who loved taking pictures and solving physics problems. But high school changed me to set goals in my life and to face and overcome any obstacle thrown at me. NNHS shaped me into the person who I am today. I learned to be a leader by creating an aeronautical club. I used my passion for photography to grow as the Managing Editor of NNHS’s Yearbook. When I was on the stage at my graduation addressing more than 5000 people, I realized that this was just the beginning of what my life has in store for me to discover and that our lives never end at High school. I am glad to say my journey didn’t end here but opened the door to a new chapter in my life, college. Everyone has their own journey after high school and my journey is laying at the doors of the University of Illinois at Chicago.

				UIC, a new chapter, and a new part of my life. Quite happy to say that it has been super interesting, but super challenging. So many new people and lots of competing with myself among the smartest minds. Currently, I’m the treasurer of the Linux User Group in which I code for the most part of the day and implement ideas about possible start-ups. Life has many twists and turns, but little did I know mine were my blogs. 1 year ago I started with very few words on a page, and with very few people to share, but today they are one of my most precious achievements to show me as the best writer I believe to be. If one year could bring this much  change in me, I am really excited to see what my next three years at UIC will look like.
