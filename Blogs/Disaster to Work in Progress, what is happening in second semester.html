          Zero percent personal time, A writing project for English, two major assignments for Critical Thinking, three Computer Science projects, four Midterms, five mathematical computing labs, and six feet tall me surviving on less than seven hours of sleep. There are still eight more exams, nine more essays, and in less than ten weeks to complete the second semester, this is the story of my life. When I wanted to write about this blog, I wanted to write something opposite to the previous blog on calendar planning because things were not going as smoothly as I wanted for the second semester.
      </p>

        Maybe because I was over planning the second semester or even the workload was a little too much, but there has been a time in this semester, where I slept for three hours and lived on coffee the entire day. Somehow I saw a lot of change in me, so I decided to throw away my old calendar plan and make the new one for the next ten weeks, sorry the next ten crucial weeks.

        Tip 1: Take some personal time and spend it with your family, I believe this is one of the hardest phases of my life. I used to talk for hours with my parents in a day during high school, but now I don’t even get thirty minutes to talk. I don’t complain about my schedule, but I need to give myself some time. So, I can relax and give myself some time to sleep.
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 2: Work on my fitness, from next week I want to work out for at least thirty minutes a day to keep my body and mind sharp. I believe that this time might actually help me in my daily life too. 
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 3: Productive sleep, if you sleep for five hours only, then make that sleep the most peaceful. Don’t think about anything else during that time. Personally I hate naps because I can’t break my concentration on work and sleep, so I suggest avoiding naps and sleep well and constant at whatever the time you sleep. 
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 4: To all my friends who commute, try making your commute as much fun and interesting as possible.  If you don’t like reading on the way home, try to watch series, or to listen to podcasts, or even explore music. I used this time and started exploring different web series and anthologies.
      </p>

        Let us see, how does this affect my life and the interesting second semester. I don’t know if I am actually going to work, or actually give myself personal time, but I will try to learn something new from every move I make. I recently told my father a quote I wrote and I want to share it here, “Every time I feel lost, I will reinvent myself.”  Now, it’s time for me to go give some personal time, see you all next week.
