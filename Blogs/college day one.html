          College is a huge step in many people’s lives. I recently started my college at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I was thinking about one word that would describe my first day of college and that one word is overwhelming. I felt as if I was starting a brand new life all over from the beginning, but I have already met so many different people with PhDs, Masters, and extreme talent. I thought about sharing some of my tips for your day 1.
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Walk your schedule before college starts. This may seem like a silly thing to do, but trust me, you are going to be lost on campus. Walking around the campus also makes you more confident about your first day and you can feel prepared.
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Check your college email. Some professors may email you their syllabus or add you to their portals. If you read their syllabi before classes start, you can get ahead of the game. Sometimes Teaching Assistants (TA’s) email you about discussions and weekly schedules, so do read your emails before the first day of classes.    </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Check out all the activities and events that your college may have planned for you. There is a lot happening on the campus the first day (usually including the first week and the week before too). You can meet a lot of people during those activities. You can meet many of the organizations from your school, and it will especially help you get more connections in college.    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Sleep well the night before Day 1. I know it is really hard to control anxiety levels, but it is very important for you to sleep well. Sleep well and have a great breakfast: it will be a great start to your new journey.
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Check the weather and dress accordingly. I started my first day with full of clouds and rain. It was not the best way to start my college because of the weather. So check the weather, wear suitable clothing, and always carry an umbrella with you.
    </p>

    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Everyone has a unique story regarding the first day of college. Make your first day really memorable because this place will be your home for the next four years. I wish you all the very best for your new journey.
