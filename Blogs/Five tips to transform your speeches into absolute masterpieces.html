        Speech is an art. And like any art, it can be used not only as a platform to not only share your knowledge, but also to express your beliefs and emotions. However, it can be a difficult art to master. For some people, the scariest thing on earth is talking in front of a group of people. I was one of those people until I was in fifth grade, but I had to go on to stage every day to give the daily announcements to 300+ students in the morning. After the first few weeks, I really felt comfortable on the stage and started enjoying my speeches. Later, when I started high school, I really enjoyed talking in front of the class but noticed that a lot of people were still as scared as I was the first time I stepped on stage to deliver the announcements. So if you’re one of those people, or even if you just want to improve your already mastered speech skills, here’s a few tips to make to process just a little easier.
