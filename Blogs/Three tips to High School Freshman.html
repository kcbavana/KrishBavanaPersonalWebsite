        At the beginning of high school, everyone has a set of expectations for themselves in the new journey that they’re about to start. When I stepped in to high school for the first time, I also had a lot of expectations for myself for the years to come. I wanted to build robots, I wanted to be well recognized, and become the best speechwriter and speaker in the entire school. I went to a large high school, with over 2800 students and 300+ staff members, so going into freshman year, I was really overwhelmed. I was the first person in my family to study in the United States, so I had to find my own unique path. Trying to figure out where I fit in was tricky when I was also trying to keep my grades up, and get the best of high school, so I created a list that makes it all just a little bit easier: Start of a new journey, everyone has their own set of expectations for high school. I had so many expectations while entering into high school too. I wanted to build a robot, I wanted to be well recognized and I wanted to be the best speaker of my school. I went to a super big high school with almost 2800 people and 300+ staff members and it was really overwhelming for me to start my high school. I was the first student from my family to go to high school in the USA. I had to find my own unique path and I always want to be a good student with good grades. Then I made a list of things that would help everyone who is entering into high school.

        Number One: Join Clubs! It will be a little tricky to manage your time to study and get involved in extracurriculars, but it is very important to make time for activities outside of school. They will help introduce you to different it is really hard to manage time for you and study but it also really important for you to get involved in the clubs. You will get opportunities to meet new people, and opportunities to get hands on time with things that you love to do that aren’t a part of your everyday school curriculum. Another benefit of joining in different clubs is the weight that they will have on your college resume.

        Number Two: Pick your classes wisely. It is a very large factor of your high school life. It is not about the honors classes or AP Classes, choose classes that will help on your journey to college. Talk to seniors who have already taken that class regarding any question you have about it. Every class you take over the next four years will help you in one way or another for what’s to come.       
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Number 3: Volunteer and give back to the community. You will not only get to know the people in your community better, but also form connections with different people who may be of use to you when the time comes. It will also improve your conversation/communication skills with different kinds of people and look great on your college resume.       
      </p>

        Lastly, enjoy every minute of the four years to come. It may seem long now, but time will pass you by very quickly, and before you know it, you’ll be entering adulthood, wishing you could be that high school kid again.
