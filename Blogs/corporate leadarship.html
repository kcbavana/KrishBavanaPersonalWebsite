        Introduction:
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Leadership is key for everything in this world from White House politics to leaders in high schools. Everyone helps the community to live better and do some service to our society, whereas the leadership style in corporate is not about social service but it is about making their company and economy better. Movies and TV shows like, “The Social Network”, “Steve Jobs” and “The Founder” explain how leadership in different phases helps the companies to grow. The literature concerning this topic identifies why corporate leaders need to behave harshly in terms of  being rude and angry with employees and how it impacts the company’s growth, the country’s economy, and the output of its product.

        Why movies portray corporate leader negatively:
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Some of the movies like “Steve Jobs and The Founder” portrayed corporate leaders in negative roles, whereas “Jobs and Inside Bill’s Brain by Netflix” portrayed corporate leaders in a positive role but when portraying a corporate leader, the position of the leader and company matters too. According to the How Is Leadership Different At Startup Companies Than With Larger, More Traditional Corporations? quotes, “ The leaders in traditional companies believe that they have the ultimate authority over everyone. The longer the tenure of these leaders, the higher up the ladder they get to climb.” This quote explains that the attitude of the leaders change as they climb up the corporate ladder, that is the reason why some filmmakers portray corporate leaders negatively. The other example from the article, The Leadership Style That Will Brings a Startup Long-Term Success by Chris Myers identities, “Transitioning into this mature management style can be an incredibly difficult task for founders who risked everything to build their company, but it is by no means impossible.” This quote explains why many leaders change their attitude as they risked everything being a founder, so sometimes they have to take some serious decisions which may affect how others see them and therefore results in people thinking them as negative and filmmakers showing them as harsh bosses.

        Women as corporate leaders:
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Many filmmakers make movies, TV shows, and Documentaries on CEOs frequently. That was one of the reasons why societies were able to understand leaders but there are very few movies or shows on female corporate leaders, but women like Indra Nooyi, Mary T. Barra have  done some great contributions to their companies and that of the country’s economy, but no filmmakers were interested in making films on them. According to the article, How Women Leaders Change Company Dynamics Kweilin Ellingrud explains, “ The gender gap also has a significant economic impact. If women were to participate more equally to men in the workplace, that could drive $28 trillion in growth—the size of the economies of the U.S. and China put together.” This quote explains women in corporate companies have a huge impact not just on the companies economy but also on the country’s GDP. The women CEOs just don’t help raise the GDP of the country but their positive attitude will have a positive impact on the company. In the article, Do Companies With Female Executives Perform Better? Tim Lemke states, “According to a number of studies in recent years, there is increasing evidence that women in executive positions and on corporate boards can have a positive impact on a company’s performance.” This quote explains that women empowerment will have a positive impact on the company which will result in better performance by employees and more money to the company. Women running companies have both a positive impact and make a lot of money yet filmmakers and screenwriters barely focus on their success making stories.

        How companies help to better Economy:
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        In a few TV shows like “House of Cards” and “Designated Survivor,” they show the importance of the corporate companies and how they can affect the economy. In the article, The Roles of Business Organizations in Economic Development Danielle Smyth says, “The success of a business as a whole directly affects the world’s economy. At its core, businesses are designed to serve a particular need that people have, and to provide trusted goods and services related to that need.” This quote explains that the businesses are run for people and whenever a customer buys a product, some of that money will be turned into tax and others will help the companies to grow, which will directly affect the economy. Not just big companies but also small companies have a huge impact on the economy, In the article, Small Businesses and Their Impact on the Economy by Kimberly Amadeo explains, Small business are a major contributor to the economy with at least 65% of revenue and most have the cities have a small business which hires people and their contribution to towards the taxes help the revenue of the country. Without small business and their contribution, the country would still be in losses. Some screenwriters and authors conveyed this through books like, “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” but still many people don’t know the impact of the corporate/Small business contribution towards the Economy.

        Conclusion:
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        In conclusion, according to the literature on this topic, corporate leaders are portrayed negatively, never show their contribution towards the economy and they always fail in showing the female corporate leaders. However, most of the time corporate leaders need to behave harshly or negatively for their company’s growth. Not all leaders might have a good reason to be harsh and mean but some of them are just portrayed negatively because filmmakers never understood the struggle of the leaders to keep their company on the top. In the end, corporate leaders work for their benefits but many recognize to see their struggle and how they impact our economy.
