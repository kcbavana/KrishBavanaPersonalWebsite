        Stories, stories, and more stories. We are all filled with stories and every story has a goal, a motto and a soul in it. Seven billion people and every person has a different story to tell but today this story is about me; Krish Bavana. It’s not a great story, but a story of a guy with dreams. The most common structure of a story is the beginning, middle and conclusion, but today I want to tell a story of a beginning with an unfinished ending. I really don’t know where to start,  but if it needs an introduction, I would start it as an average looking, six-foot-tall guy born in a very small village trying to dream about establishing his own company. Seven different schools crossed the seas, one university met thousands of people in my life, many became friends, but very few become best friends and the two people that I love. It’s not a complicated life, but one question made my life more complicated, what is the purpose of my life?
      </p>

        This seems like a very simple question, but I have no answer to this question. The first time I asked this question to myself was when I got a ‘D’ in sixth grade, what is the purpose of my life. The second time was when no one understood my project on solar energy in seventh grade. The third time I came across this question was when my teacher compared me to trash. Then I really stopped counting the times I thought  about this question, but I do remember making myself ask this question a few minutes before giving the graduation speech at Naperville north high school. I really didn’t have an answer to that question, but it made me realize that the bigger you dream, the greater the purpose of your life increases. We all watch superhero movies right, whenever he solves a very big problem, he becomes our hero. When Ironman killed Thanos that was his purpose of life, it was to save people,  but Iron man’s dream of saving people was what made him a hero. The same way when you dream big and achieve your goals, you will be a hero. However, achieving your goals will be something challenging, but it’s something you’ve always dreamt of.

        One question that might come into your mind now, is one dream enough for a lifetime or some might think, what is this dreaming this guy is talking about? A Dream changes, A dream builds you and a dream makes you reinvent yourself. Dream big every day, dream about something that would bring you a one first step closer to your goal in life. My dreams kept on changing in every phase of my life. As a kid I dreamt of being a doctor, then I wanted to be a highly ranked government officer in India.  Then for some time, I wanted to do robotics and go into aeronautics, finally, now I want to be an entrepreneur and build a software product. I was always dreaming of something big and wild!, When I was in the aeronautics phase of my life, I just didn’t want to learn how flights worked but I wanted to make everyone at my school have a chance to learn about aeronautics. I worked with one of my favorite teacher/people to create a club at my high school and we started ‘Flying Huskies’ the first aeronautical club in the state of Illinois, we built a model of airplanes, quads, and hoverboards, the group increased from two people to more than thirty people, and by the time I graduated the  club was still running at Naperville North High School. What makes me even more proud is that ‘Flying Huskies’ is still flying to this moment. If I just dreamt about my learning, now there wouldn’t have been a space for many aspiring engineers to explore their interests. My dreams never stopped at flying huskies, but when I decided to be an entrepreneur I worked on many tiny details that would make my dream bigger.

        It is not just about dreaming, it is about making them come true to complete the circle. one of the biggest dreams I had at Naperville North High School was to be a Graduation speaker, but is it possible as an English as a Second Language student? From the day I wanted to be a graduation speaker, I worked on becoming a better speaker. I never told anyone about my dreams, but I always worked on them. Here comes that question again, what is the purpose of my life? I really don’t know my purpose in life, but at every stage of my life, I met great people with great intentions.

        Every person in their life goes through a lot to make their dream come true, but no one remembers the people who have always helped them. There are many people in my life that helped me to dream big and never let me compromise. I think I should write a separate blog about each one of them because these words aren’t enough for how much they helped me achieve my goals. However, few mentions are very mandatory because it is one of my very special blogs. First and foremost My father and my mother really need to thank them the most because I was never a very good, straight A student until I was in high school. It was really hard being a parent to accept the fact that your kid is falling behind, because you see all other kids are targeting and getting straight A’s, yet here I am explaining about my science experiments and worst projects. If they didn’t support me, then I would have never been dreaming about anything, maybe I would be reading about dreams. There are a lot of teachers and professors to mention in this but due to space constraints I am only mentioning four people. Mr. Ram (Physics Teacher), you just didn’t teach me physics but you taught me life and dreaming. I almost lost hopes in my projects and my style of studying and then I met you. The second person is Mrs. Sternecky, I am really glad I met you in my eight grade and you were my mentor my entire high school life. If I had any problem I knew you were there and your encouragement helped me to dream big. The third person is Miss. Girigs, I really don’t know when I met you but I think that would be the best day of my life because you always made me believe that I can do anything. You were one of those people that I told that I want to be an entrepreneur and I can never forget your support. Finally, Professor Reed Dale, I was really scared of coding in C++ as I entered this semester, but if I am able to code in C++ perfectly today it’s truly your support. But not only C++ because of you I am able to write anything with confidence. You changed my perspective of coding, now everytime I open to code something I really am doing something great. Because of you all in my life I am still dreaming big and bigger every single day. I know my beginning doesn’t have a conclusion yet but it has many memories to cherish, and many dreams that I have achieved. But to finish off, I want you all to ask one question to yourself, what is your biggest dream?
