        I love storytelling, sometimes I tell stories with my code, sometimes with my photography, other times with Data Science, but many times I tell them with my words and if I have to tell where it all began, the first answer without any doubt would be my high school yearbook productions. Most of the people at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), know me either as a python developer or as a C++ developer or as a loving CS student, but if you were to question the same to those who know me at Naperville North High School (NNHS), they see me as the yearbook guy or the yearbook editor. I think this explains how much the yearbook has impacted my life. For the first time, I got a chance to pick the classes I wanted to do at high school. I started picking different classes to explore different interests, flipped through the prerequisites. I came across many but only one caught my eye and that was the yearbook. I think at least ten to fifteen people asked me, are you sure about doing that class? You are still a beginner in writing, maybe choose a different class, for now, do it in your tenth grade and the suggestions went on and on and on. At one point, I started questioning my own decision about taking yearbook productions, but after so much confusion and drama, I took the class.

        The whole summer I was not thinking about it, but as the school started reopening so did my stress about the yearbook. I always loved taking risks in my life, but questions like is this a good risk? Will this hurt me or benefit me? Were spinning all around my head. The first day has finally arrived and I am really happy about all the classes and teachers because everyone was very friendly and introductions happened really well. With so much happiness, I was eagerly waiting for the fifth class of the day, so I can step into Room 121 aka The Yearbook room. The vibe about the room itself was really different compared to the other classes. There was a  locked room inside the classroom with different quotes attached around. Just by the sight of it,  I was slightly overwhelmed, but I started to get excited about the product I was a part of. The first person in the class that came to greet me was my first boss and the editor in chief of yearbook productions, Sara Babu. I strongly believe that the first talk with you was what made me stay in the yearbook, you gave me a lot of confidence Sara. I was really happy about meeting her, but the real surprise package was meeting Mrs. Mazz and Mr. Williams. I was really scared about talking to you both on the first day but I remember crying in the same room in front of you two because I was going to miss two great people. The classes started to begin, every class was going at a different pace and yearbook production was going at a very different pace, and I wasn’t quite sure why it was really slow, but it took me three weeks to fully understand that the pace would just get crazier. We built friendships, bonds, learned skills, and finally, it was the time to challenge ourselves.

        The first three weeks were the honeymoon period, I had no responsibilities or anything, but I began to feel the pressure after three weeks. First interview in my yearbook journey, I really enjoyed talking with people, but this was different and quite challenging because It required me to meet a new person, talk with him, get his interview and write it. I still had an opportunity to quit and do something normal, but I chose to be in the yearbook because I want to challenge myself and explore my writing. Sara, Molly, Gretchen, Jacob, Izzy, Bev you  were all there for me when I was transforming from a bad writer to a good writer, I think your patience was one of the biggest reasons why I am able to write really well today.

        If something better than my writing improved in the yearbook, it was my photography. I was able to learn a lot about angles, color, lighting, repetition, and I was able to see a new me after I started photography. I got a lot of confidence to see people and take their pictures. It opened me to look at someone or a moment from different perspectives. This was one of the most beautiful phases I have been through because I was still trying to get better at what I do. I always had a lot of curiosity, but it has grown so much after being a photographer at yearbook. My favorite part about being a yearbook photographer was I had no boundaries, I could go to any event, take pictures, experiment with lighting and be a dreamer. Time started to fly and before I knew it my freshman year has ended. The most awaited moment has arrived, seeing the yearbook. I was never that thrilled because I am holding a product, but this time I worked for more than 8 months and that feeling can be replaced.

        As A sophomore I lost the opportunity to be in the class the first semester, but I made sure my schedule worked for the second semester. Somehow I was not really happy with my efforts, I changed myself and worked really hard for the better product. I completed my sophomore year too but I know bigger challenges are waiting.

        This is just the beginning phase of the yearbook journey and surprisingly many more interesting things happened later. Sacrificed my lunchtime, dreamed of becoming an editor, led the team, won awards, cried, laughed, enjoyed the moments, made videos, cherished memories, promoted, learned about business. This is just the beginning, to be continued…
