        Have you guys ever heard about the butterfly effect? It is a very common theory used in many movies, but recently I have experienced a new effect called the ‘Bat’ effect. From someone eating bats in China to transitioning to online classes at the University of Illinois Chicago, it’s quite astonishing how everything is interlinked. I know it is not just me or my university, but many students around the world are struggling to go through this phase in their lives. I have seen many people hating online classes, while others love them because of their priorities. However, a few people asked me about how to be motivated for online classes. I want to give some tips for online classes and how students can work smartly during this difficult phase.
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 1: Plan your day appropriately. It is really easy for students who have long breaks in the middle of the day to lose their focus. So plan your day correctly. Even those breaks should be utilized for attending office hours, talking to TA’s, making notes, or even going through slides ahead of time. Try to do something productive and useful to stay focused. I have three breaks in the middle of the day that I used to go to office hours, or explain to my friends some CS concepts or clarify my doubts. Now I will still do the same thing except online. I believe high schoolers don’t have this problem, but even if you have breaks, still use them productively.
      </p>
      <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 2: Attend Classes. Some of our teachers may be lenient about attendance because some will have internet issues and they may not be able to make it for instruction. If you are one of them, it is fine; however, if you have an active internet, think about attending the classes rather than just skipping them. Some professors might give you extra credit for solving some tough problems during the lecture. You know never what life has in store. 
      </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 3: Please, Please, Please, take good notes. When the news about online classes came out, people were so excited that they could just log in and not listen in to class. If you are not planning to take notes or listen to them, then that is a very big problem because some of our exams may end up being open notes and then you won’t be able to refer to anything because you haven’t taken notes. Taking some notes will always help you at some point. 
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 4: Utilize Online Resources. There might be a time where you have a very important question and you might not get hold of them for some reason. In those cases, there are some very useful tools like LinkedIn Learning, Khan Academy (Free), and YouTube (Free but not very reliable). Sometimes even if you want to learn beyond the concepts, they will help you understand further.
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 5: Make discussions, ask yourself questions, and write a summary at the end of the day, but make sure to learn every day because it is really easy to lose track of what is happening in the class due to the chaos outside. So choose a way to analyze your day and see what concepts you understood the most and what you didn’t. This way you can prioritize what you need to focus on the most. 
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        The real question is how can we be motivated when we don’t actually meet in person or walk out of our room, but all I say is to motivate yourself by using this opportunity as a way to connect with others and learn from a new environment. It’s best to not put high expectations on grades or other key rewards. My Psychology teacher once told me multiple times about a concept called Punished by Rewards. Don’t reward yourself too much for just attending the class or for listening to it.

        Three Tips for concentration:
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 1: After every class (period), stand up and take a tiny walk in your home itself. It might not be very productive, but you will be given a sense of relaxation.
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 2: Blink your eyes every once in a while. Don’t stare continuously at the monitor/laptop for too long. Sometimes, if you focus completely and stay near your laptop, your eyes may feel pressured and tight due to a lack of movement. 
    </p>
    <p class = blog-paragraph>
        Tip 3: Ask yourself questions at the end of the day. You be the judge and see what you learned in a day.
    </p>

        Finally, the best thing is to reinvent yourself because you barely get time to focus on you, now this is the best time to understand you. The next few months are not going to be easy for anyone. We all have to go through some tough times before completing this academic year. I hope all of you will plan your online classes correctly and complete this phase successfully.
