                      Have you guys ever heard about the butterfly effect? It is a very common theory used in many movies, but recently I have experienced a new effect called the ‘Bat’ effect. From someone eating bats in China to transitioning to online classes at the University of Illinois Chicago, it’s quite astonishing how everything is interlinked....

One month break during my college is really useful for me, and I had many plans for this break, but the most important one was to regain my sleep. Apart from my sleep, I had five important things to do during the break and they are...

My hobby was always watching movies, I’ve loved them from a young age. Now you might ask, how did movies help me grow in my career or outside my career? I started telling stories in seventh grade and fell in love with creating them in ninth grade. I always enjoyed creating characters and multiple scenarios for every situation.

                      Three weeks into freshman year here at UIC, and I can already say with much confidence, that I’ve learned a lot. I’ve met people from all over the world, and faced a few challenges, but I know that this is just the beginning. When I was in high school, many people used to say that...

                      College is a huge step in many people’s lives. I recently started my college at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

If you have already completed reading part 1, continue reading this. Everyone is not you, it is really weird that we expect everyone to do the same amount of work that we do.

                      It seems as though the world is in a large search for leaders nowadays. Whether you try out for a team, apply for a job, or look for colleges, it looks like everybody wants “a leader.” So what constitutes a leader? What makes these leaders so desirable in every situation? For many years, people called me a leader, and though I didn’t understand what it was about me that made me a leader; I thought nothing of it, and continued on accepting the title; allowing it to slightly raise my self-confidence. But in my Junior year of high school...

                      At the beginning of high school, everyone has a set of expectations for themselves in the new journey that they’re about to start. When I stepped in to high school for the first time, I also had a lot of expectations for myself for the years to come. I wanted to build robots, I wanted to be well recognized, and become the best speechwriter and speaker in the entire school. I went to a large high school, with over 2800...

                      Starting life as a freshman all over again after four great years of high school is never easy. We all are adjusted to our school schedules, regular hangouts, sports, practices, extracurricular and all the lovely people who made going to school every day worth it. But in order to move forth in life, and take our very first steps in adulthood, we will have to make many adjustments, and let go of a few of the most memorable aspects of our high school lives. If you want to enjoy your next four years, you need a ...

                      “Time is of the essence.” A quote we’ve all heard, and all probably dreaded at one point or another. Until I was a freshman in high school, I didn’t need to be reminded of this phrase to get through life. I would just sleep for eight hours, eat on time, and finish the minimal work I had. Then I entered high school. A whole new world of opportunities. With over 120 clubs in my school, half of which I was interested in, and too good to resist offers like being part of student board and exploring...                    </p>

                      Speech is an art. And like any art, it can be used not only as a platform to not only share your knowledge, but also to express your beliefs and emotions. However, it can be a difficult art to master. For some people, the scariest thing on earth is talking in front of a group...
